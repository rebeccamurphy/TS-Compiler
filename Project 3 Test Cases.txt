Project 3 Test Cases:

1: over flows dah heap
{
    string h
    h = "so how you doing im pretty well i dont know how you are but yeah thats great"
    string p
    p = "do you think i have enough space for this isnt a lot of space"
    
}$


2: I didn't actually try to account for nested booleans so this is an error.
{
int a 
a =0
	if (true == (a==2) ){
		print ("HAHA")
        }

}$

Correct Code:

{
    int i
    i = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9
    print(i);
}$
